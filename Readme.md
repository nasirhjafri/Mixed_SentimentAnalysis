#Code-Mixed Sentiment Analysis
***
This work describes the participation of **LIMSI\_UPV** team in **SemEval-2020 Task 9: Sentiment Analysis for Code-Mixed Social Media Text**.
The proposed approach competed in SentiMix Hindi-English subtask, that addresses the problem of predicting the sentiment of a given Hindi-English code-mixed tweet. 
We propose **Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network** that combines both the recurrent neural network and the convolutional network to better capture the semantics of the text, for code-mixed sentiment analysis.
